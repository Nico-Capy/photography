        <p class="text-xl p-4">I'm a developer, photographer, drone pilot, videographer, and brewer. Sometimes, I merge these pursuits. Behold, an online photo gallery!

            <br/>
            Photography was not my calling. I stumbled into it as a means to escape the tedium of school. But I realized that the answer was to innovate. And experiment, I did. From drones to pinhole lenses, from infrared to analog, from street photography to studio portraits â€” I explored it all. Suffice to say, I reveled in the pursuit.
